# Pomodoro-Clock
A freecodecamp front-end project which improves your time management skills.
//
This is a freecodecamp front-end development final project. I have used vanila.js to build this. It took me a very long time. After taking more than 20 attempts from the very beginning of the javascript, somehow I managed to complete it. 
The user stories for the projects were:-
i)  start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
ii) reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
iii)customize the length of each pomodoro.
